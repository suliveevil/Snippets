 **Goal:** Add more opponents.

 You can play against up to four opponents. To add new opponents to the game, call `addOpponent` on the `game` object.
 
 To win a round with more than two players, a player must beat at least one other player and not lose to any others.
 
 Try adding three more opponents to the game.
 
 **Play:** Experiment with modifying the actions and rules to see how the game changes with more opponents.
 
 When you're ready, move on to the [next page](@next) to see an example of the setup game function.
