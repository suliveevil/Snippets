 **Goal:** Modify the code to personalize your game.
 
 Look at the **SharedCode** file and read through the code to figure out how the game is set up. The code you write in `setup(game:)` will be saved and used in all pages of this book.
 
 1. Try modifying the emoji values for `game.addAction`, `game.addOpponent`, and `game.prize`.
 2. Try changing the colors for `game.myColor` or `game.backgroundColors`.
 
 When you‚Äôre ready, move on to the [next page](@next) to explore adding more actions and defining new rules for the game.
